\section{The Challenge 2024: Shared Autonomy}

In the 2024 technical challenge, the teams have to develop a mixed team that consists of one human-operated Nao robot and one fully autonomous Nao.
This challenge will consist of matches of two vs two robots on the standard SPL field. 

\subsection{The Goal}

This challenge takes a step towards the goal of enabling robots to play on the same field as agents with human level intelligence.
To level the playing field in terms of physical embodiment, all players will be Nao robots.
However, each team will have one of their robots be remotely operated by a human to provide human-level intelligence for robot control.
The other robot will be fully autonomous in accordance with the main SPL competition rules.\\
