# B-Human Code Release

This is the official 2021 B-Human code release. Documentation can be found in our [public wiki](https://wiki.b-human.de/coderelease2021/).

Previous code releases are tagged with "coderelease&lt;year&gt;", where &lt;year&gt; is the year in which the code was released (starting with 2013).

Please note that **before** you clone this repository on Windows, execute:
```
git config --global core.autocrlf input
git config --global core.eol lf
```

As this repository uses submodules, it must be cloned using `git clone --recursive`. Downloading the release as `zip` or `tar.gz` does not work.
