# B-Human Code Release

This is the official 2021 B-Human code release.

Previous code releases are tagged with "coderelease&lt;year&gt;", where &lt;year&gt; is the year in which the code was released (starting with 2013).

Please note that **before** you clone this repository on Windows, execute:
```
