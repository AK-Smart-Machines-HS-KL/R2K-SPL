Preamble: R-ZWEI Kickers release the software they use at RoboCup
competitions in compliance with league regulations and to
provide the tools we develop to other teams in order to further
scientific development and provide tools and ideas to help newer
teams set foot in the league, just like they got helped when they
started out.
In the spirit of Open Source we want to document the challenges
we faced as well as the contributions we could make, practical
and scientific.
