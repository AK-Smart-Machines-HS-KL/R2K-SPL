\section{Introduction}

\subsection{About the team}

We're a (usually) mixed team of vocational students, university students, professors and industrial partners that was founded in 2020 and has since participated in various competitions and challenges, with our most recent achievement being 2nd place in the RoboCup SPL world championship in the challenge shield division.

\subsubsection{History / Achievements}

\paragraph{2020} After branching off of B-Human's 2019 code release in 2020 we didn't compete in any competition that same year, since we first had to establish our own code base and apply for qualification towards that next year's competitions.

\paragraph{2021} In 2021, a world competition with a lot of teams was not possible, due to restrictions imposed during the CoVid-19 pandemic. However, the committees and organizing members of the league did host a digital competition featuring four different challenges, two of which the Kickers were able to successfully participate in.

These challenges were:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Obstacle Avoidance:} Unfortunately we couldn't get our software to work quite right 
\end{itemize}

%TODO: Add results

\paragraph{2022} In 2022, the RoboCup World Championship was hosted yet again, but for financial reasons, the Kickers weren't able to participate.

\paragraph{2023} %TODO

\paragraph{2024} %TODO
