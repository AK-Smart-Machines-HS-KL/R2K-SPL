 * @file GoalieLongShotCard.cpp
 * @author Nicholas Pfohlmann, Adrian MÃ¼ller
 * @version: 1.0
 *
 * Functions, values, side effects:
 * - this card qualifies for the GOALIE player if the balls x-Pos is below the 
 *   circumcenter x-Pos of triangle formed by default pos of GL, DL, DR
 * - it will take its time to make a long kick if no opppenent is too close
 *
 * Details:
 * Purpose of this card is to clear the own field by a long shot.
 * - opponent is not to close (otherwise see ClearOwnHalf)
 * - isPlayBall()
 * - long shot to opponent goal, using correct foot:
 *   - left or right is computed once, when the card is called for the first time
 *   - reason: while approaching the ball, the relative y-position might vary (for only a few centimeters),
 *             causing the skill to "freeze"
 * - goalie will not go beyond circumcenter x-Pos
 *
 * After kick:
 * - a) card exists if role no longer is playsTheBall()
 * - b) exit after kick (isDone()) to avoid goalie player chase the ball
 *
 * Note:
 * - because this is a long shot, the flag "playsTheBall" typicall is re-set after the shot, as a side effect.
 * - However, if the ball is stuck, the flag may still be set, and the player will follow the ball
 * - If goalie walks closer to ball it can occur that he is still playsTheBall but ball is beyond 
 *   the centroid x-Pos if ball was moved
 *
 * ToDo:
 * check for free shoot vector and opt. change y-coordinate
 * check whether isDone () works correctly
 * check for GoToBallAndKick options (eg "precisey") for better pormance
 * 
 * read default Positions from DefualtPoseProvider
 * provide max opp distance as LOAD_PARAMETERS
