 * @file DefenseLongShotCard.cpp
 * @author Nicholas Pfohlmann, Adrian MÃ¼ller 
 * @version: 1.2
 *
 * Functions, values, side effects: 
 * - this card qualifies for the one DEFENSE player only who is closest to the ball
 * - it will take its time to make a long kick if no opppenent is too close 
 * - it will make a faster, more unprecise version of the kick if opponent is closer
 *
 * Details: 
 * Purpose of this card is to clear the own field by a long shot.
 * - opponent is not to close (otherwise see ClearOwnHalf) and my distance to ball < opponents distance to ball
 * - isPlayBall()
 * - long shot to opponent goal, using correct foot: 
 *   - left or right is computed once, when the card is called for the first time
 *   - reason: while approaching the ball, the relative y-position might vary (for only a few centimeters),
 *             causing the skill to "freeze"
 * - defense will not leave own half, unless we are in OFFENSIVE or SPARSE Mode
 * 
 * 
 * v1.1: added kick variations (precise and unprecise) and now using opponent-ball as distance
 *       and check if I am closer to ball than opponent
 * V1.2: uses new enum LongShotType in KickInfo.h for precise and fast longshot
 * 
 * After kick:
 * - a) card exists if role no longer is playsTheBall()
 * - b) exit after kick (isDone()) to avoid defenser player chase the ball 
 * 
 * Note: 
 * - because this is a long shot, the flag "playsTheBall" typicall is re-set after the shot, as a side effect.
 * - However, if the ball is stuck, the flag may still be set, and the player will follow the ball
 * - This behavior is ok in OFFENSIVE and SPARSE mode
 * 
 *  v.1.3 precond: x < 0 - threshold. 
 *      Activated !aBuddyIsClearingOwnHalf
 *  v.1.4 Added the online & offline role assignment(Asrar)
 * ToDo: 
 * check for free shoot vector and opt. change y-coordinate
 * check whether isDone () works correctly 
 * 
 * provide max opp distance as LOAD_PARAMETERS
