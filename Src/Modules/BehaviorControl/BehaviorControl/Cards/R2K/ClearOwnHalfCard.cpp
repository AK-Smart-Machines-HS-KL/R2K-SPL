 * @file ClearOwnHalfCard.cpp
 * @author  Adrian MÃ¼ller 
 * @version: 1.0
 *
 * Functions, values, side effects: 
 * any TACTICAL_GOALIE and ...DEFENSE with playsTheBall()
 * no other card qualifies for 
 * - ball is in own half
 * - there is not enough time to do a long shot (see ....LongShotCards), 
 *  -so bot does a fast kick (walkForwardsRight,walkForwardsLeft), in his walking direction 
 *
 * Details: 
 * Purpose of this card is to clear the own field by a long shot.
 * - opponent is to close (otherwise see ClearOwnHalf)
 * - isPlayBall()
 * - quick using correct foot: 
 *   - left or right is computed once, when the card is called for the first time
 *   - reason: while approaching the ball, the relative y-position might vary (for only a few centimeters),
 *             causing the skill to "freeze"
 * - bot will not leaf own half,
 * 
 * v.1.1: increased minOppDistance to 2000
 * v1.2. added setPlay==SET_PLAY_NONE to prevent bots go for CORNER_KICK
 *       changed to theTeammateRoles.isTacticalDefense : goalie must not leave the goal box
 * 
 * Note: 
 * - because this is a short shot, the flag "playsTheBall" may not re-set after the shot, 
 * - However, if the ball is stuck, the flag may still be set, and the player will follow the ball
 * - This behavior is ok if not in SPARSE mode
 * - minOppDistance must be maintained with the ...LongShotCards
 * 
 * 
 * v.1.3 precond: x < 0 - threshold. 
 *      Activated !aBuddyIsClearingOwnHalf
 * v.1.4 Added the online & offline role assignment(Asrar)
 * ToDo:
 * - we need a better shooting direction!! 
 * - maybe add OFFENSIVE mode as a blocker?
